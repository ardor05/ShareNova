## Challenges We Overcame

- **Integration of Blockchain with Content Sharing**: Initially struggled with integrating blockchain technology to ensure secure transactions and verify data integrity. We overcame this by self-exploring through YouTube tutorials, official documentation, and joining Encode Clubâ€”a blockchain-focused community providing support and resources.

- **Coding in JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML**: Coding in these languages was initially challenging. We tackled this by using online resources, engaging with helpful websites, and receiving assistance from ChatGPT. Through consistent practice and experimentation, we gained proficiency.

- **Understanding the iExec Framework**: The complexity of the iExec framework was a hurdle. We addressed this by deep diving into the official documentation and testing the code repeatedly until we fully grasped its functionality and integrated it effectively.
